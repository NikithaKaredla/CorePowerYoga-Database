# CorePowerYoga-Database
The aim of this project was to develop a relational database that could be applied to CorePower Yoga, one of the largest yoga studio chains in the US. The database was designed to help the executive team analyze data from June 2022 to the present and identify trainers with high ratings. It efficiently captures session details and uses an algorithm to rate trainers based on student satisfaction survey responses. The project involved modeling the database, designing EER and UML diagrams, mapping the conceptual model to a relational model with primary and foreign keys, and implementing the database in MySQL. A prototype was also implemented in MongoDB to test its workability in a NoSQL environment. The database was successfully connected to Python, and visualizations were generated to help the executive team make informed decisions about the best performing trainers. The next phase of the project is to extend the implementation of the database to all yoga studios in Boston.
